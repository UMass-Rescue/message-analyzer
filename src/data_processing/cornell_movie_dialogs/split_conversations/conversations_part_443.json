You know, \"How do you breathe when she sits on your face?\" \"It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her.\" Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. \"I'm completely fucked up.\" \"I'm completely fucked up.\" \"I'm completely fucked up.\"  Poor fatty never had a chance."
