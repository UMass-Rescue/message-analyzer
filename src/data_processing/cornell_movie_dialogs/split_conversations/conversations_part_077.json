In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled \"Indians\" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that \"Indians\" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906."
