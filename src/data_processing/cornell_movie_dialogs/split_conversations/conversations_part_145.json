It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - \"a patsy\".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, \"O.H. Lee\" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?"
