2024-10-06 09:02,Bob,"Yeah, I did! Are you thinking about going?"
2024-10-06 09:05,Alice,"I am, but I’m not sure yet. Tickets are a bit expensive. What about you?"
2024-10-06 09:10,Bob,"I’d love to go, but I’m also debating whether it's worth the price."
2024-10-06 09:12,Alice,"I know, right? But it’s a band we both love, and they rarely come to town."
2024-10-06 09:15,Bob,That’s true. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see them live. Maybe we should just go for it.
2024-10-06 09:20,Alice,"Yeah, I'm leaning towards going. Do you think we can still get good seats?"
2024-10-06 09:22,Bob,"We might not get front-row seats, but as long as we’re there, I think it’ll be fun."
2024-10-06 09:25,Alice,You’re right. The atmosphere will be amazing no matter where we sit.
2024-10-06 09:30,Bob,"Exactly! Plus, it would be awesome to experience the live music together."
2024-10-06 09:32,Alice,"Okay, I’m convinced. Let’s get the tickets before they sell out!"
2024-10-06 09:35,Bob,"Awesome! I’ll check the ticket availability and message you the details."
2024-10-06 09:40,Bob,"Wait, are you an adult though? I think minors are not allowed."
2024-10-06 09:42,Alice,"Bro, I am 20 years old, I'll be fine."
2024-10-06 09:45,Bob,"Haha, great! Also you have to send a picture of what you're planning on wearing."
2024-10-06 09:52,Alice,"Done, a video will be coming your way"
